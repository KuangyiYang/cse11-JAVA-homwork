## Project4: AsciiArt
### Summary
The goals of this assignment are 

1) to become comfortable with using multiple classes and better understanding when Object references are useful

2) Take advantage of the ArrayList class to keep track of user-defined shapes during an interactive AsciiArt session 

3) become more comfortable with reading javadoc-created documentation and using it to guide implementation. 

This program builds on what you have learned in program #3.
