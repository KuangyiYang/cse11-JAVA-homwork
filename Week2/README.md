## Project2: Ricochet
### Summary
You are to write a java program called Countdown using the Objectdraw package introduced in class. When your program is complete, your program will look similar to the following two screen shots.

The program is to simulate a second countdown timer, with a second hand and center circle colored blue, at the center of a drawing canvas. The user inputs the size of canvas (in pixels) and a positive number of seconds to count down. A complete circle is just like an analog watch – 60 seconds. 0 seconds is indicated by straight up (or 12 O’clock on a watch). The second hand rotates clockwise.

When the user inputs a positive countdown, say K, the second hand is started at 12 O’Clock – K seconds. For example if the user inputs 15 seconds, the second hand starts at the 9 O’Clock position. If the user inputs 45 seconds, the second hand starts at the 3 O’Clock position. It is not an error for the user to input more than 60 seconds, this simply that more than one full rotation of the second hand should occur.

### Run Instruction
Make sure you in the top-level project directory 'hw/ '. Then run:
```
javac filename.java # compile doc
and 
java filename # run program
```
