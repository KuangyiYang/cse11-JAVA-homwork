## Project3 ArrayPlay
### Summary
In this assignment you will implement a class, called IntArray11, that defines and implements these operations on integer arrays.. You will then create a program called ArrayPlay, that allows you interactively create an IntArray11 instance, perform operations on that instance and print the results. The goals of this assignment are 
1) to become comfortable with defining a class and using it 
2) utilize some methods defined in the java String class
3) begin to understand how to better handle some user input errors 
4) become more comfortable with reading javadoc-created documentation and using it to guide implementation. 
This is a more complicated program that #1 or #2, so it will require you to start to develop some of your own debugging skills. It is roughly double the length of your previous assignment.

### Run Instruction
Make sure you in the top-level project directory 'Week/ '. Then run:
```
javac filename.java # compile doc
```
and 
```
java filename # run program
```
