## Project6: BlockGrid
### Summary
The program focuses on using java Swing and Threads. You will be modifying a program to achieve different results. The goal is for you to become more familiar with a non-trivial Swing program, then modify it to achieve a simple animation.

The supplied class was taken from an online post about how to create a logical grid so that each x,y coordinate in the grid is really a rectangular box. The program can only make a grid of a specific size, using hard-coded constants, and other items. The first thing you need to do is understand how this program works. You need to figure out how the classes (all coded as helper classes) work with each other, how the method paintComponent() is utilized, how the grid is created, and more.

### Run Instruction
Make sure you in the top-level project directory 'hw/ '. Then run:
```

and
```
java filename # run program
```
