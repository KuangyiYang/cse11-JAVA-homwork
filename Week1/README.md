## Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Summary
You are to create a program called RPS.java. You will use random number generator from java.util.Random to generate each player’s choice. The program first prompts for integer input to be used the numeric seed for the random number generator. Then the program uses the generator to have each of two players choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. It prints out what each player chose and then prints out who won the game. If player 1 wins, it prints out “Player 1 Wins”, if player 2 wins, it prints out “Player 2 Wins”. If neither player wins it prints out “Nobody Wins”. The program exits after playing a single game.
